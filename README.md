___Game project of OOP class___  
__Game name__: Plants vs Zombies  
__Plants vs Zombies__ (abbreviated as PvZ) is a tower defense video game developed and originally published by a group of HCMIU students. The game involves homeowners who use a variety of different plants to prevent waves of zombies from reaching the house. When a horde of zombies begins to attempt to approach the house along parallel lanes, the player must protect the house by planting trees in the lane to shoot bullets that kill the zombies or harm them. Players collect a currency called "sun" to buy plants. If a zombie reaches the house by any lane, the level is considered failed and the player will have to restart that level. In this undertaking, our team has remade this game to bring players a new version of Plants vs Zombies with many changes and improvements.

- Price per Unit and Units Sold are both discrete variable, State and Product are nominal variable
• Explanatory variable: Units Sold
• Response Variable: Price per Unit

## Goal
